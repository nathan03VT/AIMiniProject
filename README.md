# Handwriting Recognition Model

This repository contains code for a handwriting recognition model developed using PyTorch. The model architecture is designed to recognize handwritten text from images, with a focus on achieving high accuracy and generalization performance.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need the following dependencies:

- PyTorch
- tqdm
- mltu (Multi-Language Text Understanding) library
- Other standard Python libraries

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```
pip install torch tqdm mltu
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```
cd handwriting-recognition
```

3. Run the main script to train the handwriting recognition model:

```
python train_model.py
```

## Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of convolutional neural network (CNN) layers followed by a long short-term memory (LSTM) layer. The CNN layers extract features from input images, while the LSTM layer processes the extracted features to recognize sequences of characters.

## Data Preparation

The model is trained on the IAM Words dataset, which contains handwritten words in English. The dataset is preprocessed and augmented before training to improve model performance.

## Training

During training, the model is optimized using the Adam optimizer with a custom defined loss function called Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss. Various callbacks are used to monitor training progress and prevent overfitting, including early stopping and model checkpointing.

## Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated on a separate validation dataset to assess its performance in recognizing handwritten text. Evaluation metrics such as Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER) are used to measure the accuracy of the model's predictions.
